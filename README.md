# Freebox remote control

This project is a simple virtual remote control for freebox V5.

It uses the deprecated HTTP API described here: https://dev.freebox.fr/bugs/task/4327

It consists of a single web page that should work on any browser, on desktop or mobile devices.

The API requires a secret code for the remote control that is stored in the browser local storage (localStorage) in clear.
